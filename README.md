# A/B Testing Web App

This project demonstrates a simple web application where users are randomly assigned to one of two versions of a home page as part of an A/B testing experiment. The goal is to explore different user interface (UI) designs to measure user engagement. 

## Features

- **Static Intro Page**: A welcome page that introduces the web app and includes a button to proceed to the user home page.
- **A/B Testing on Home Page**: Users are randomly assigned to either version A or version B of the home page. 
- **Session Stickiness**: Once assigned to a version, users will see the same version during their session and on subsequent visits.
- **Interaction Tracking**: Button clicks are tracked to measure user engagement.
  
## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The static introductory page where users click to navigate to the home page.
- `home.html`: The home page where A/B testing logic is applied. Users are randomly assigned to either version A or B of the page.
- `styles.css`: The stylesheet containing the basic design and version-specific styles.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file implementing the A/B testing logic and interaction tracking.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
